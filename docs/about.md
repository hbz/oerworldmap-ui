## About the OER World Map

The OER World Map is the place on the web where anyone involved in Open Education can share information, experiences and ideas related to their work. Anyone can contribute to the information on the World Map and anyone can access the information on the World Map.

Since the OER World Map’s beginnings in 2014, the team and the partners of the OER World Map are striving to make Open Educational Resources (OER), related projects, actors, data and events visible on a global scale. The World Map is being built by hbz and graphthinking GmbH in association with The Open University (UK) funded by The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.

In 2019, after five years of developing, tweaking and tinkering with the OER World Map, the team has put their impact, their goals and challenges under review. We have come up with a renewed vision and a mission that feel like they can be our guiding lights in the future.

### Our Vision

We strive for a world where humans connect, share and collaborate across borders in order to foster democratic participation, social justice and sustainable development. We believe that opening up education - its institutions, its practices and its resources - is necessary to make this happen. The OER World Map contributes to this vision by facilitating the exchange of data, experiences and ideas between open educational actors and communities.

### Our Mission

We aim to facilitate exchange of data, information, experiences and ideas between different people and Open Education communities. We believe that Open Education has the potential to enhance education for all, to foster democratic participation, sustainable development and social justice. Helping others to open and transform education, its institutions, practices and resources is what gets us going every morning.

[Browse through the World Map](https://oerworldmap.org/resource/) and the many excellent projects, people and institutions who care about Open Education as much as we do.

[Create a profile](https://oerworldmap.org/auth/realms/oerworldmap/login-actions/registration?client_id=account&tab_id=Xzm_Qs0qD4g) on the World Map and add your own work, events or institution to the World Map to make it even more visible to others.
